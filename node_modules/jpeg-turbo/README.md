# node-jpeg-turbo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sorccu/node-jpeg-turbo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sorccu/node-jpeg-turbo) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/jpeg-turbo.svg)]()

**node-jpeg-turbo** provides minimal [libjpeg-turbo](http://libjpeg-turbo.virtualgl.org/) bindings for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). It is very, very fast compared to other alternatives, such as [node-imagemagick-native](https://github.com/mash/node-imagemagick-native) or [jpeg-js](https://github.com/eugeneware/jpeg-js).

Currently the focus is on decompressing images as quickly as possible.

## Requirements

We use [NAN](https://github.com/nodejs/nan) to guarantee maximum v8 API compatibility, so in theory any [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) or [io.js](https://iojs.org/) version should work fine. For maximum convenience we also use [node-pre-gyp](https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp) to publish prebuilt binaries for a few common platforms. For example, if you're on OS X and using the latest stable Node, you probably won't need to do a thing.

### If you must build from source

Due to massive linking pain on Ubuntu, we embed and build `libjpeg-turbo` directly with `node-gyp`. Unfortunately this adds an extra requirement, as the build process needs `yasm` to enable all optimizations. Note that this step is only required for `x86` and `x86_64` architectures. You don't need `yasm` if you're building on `arm`, for example.

Here's how to install `yasm`:

**On OS X**

```bash
brew install yasm
```

**On Ubuntu 14.04**

```bash
apt-get install yasm
```

**On Ubuntu 12.04**

```bash
apt-get install yasm
```

**Important!** Ubuntu 12.04 comes with GCC 4.6, which is too old to compile the add-on (and most other modules since Node.js 4.0 was released). More information is available [here](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1379).

If you really must use this module on Ubuntu 12.04, the following may work:

```bash
apt-get install python-software-properties
add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
apt-get -y install g++-4.8
export CXX=g++-4.8
```

Remember to export `CXX` when you `npm install`.

**On Debian**

```bash
apt-get install yasm
```

**On Alpine Linux**

```bash
apk add yasm
```

**Others**

Search your package manager for `yasm`.

## Installation

Make sure you've got the [requirements](#requirements) installed. Then simply install from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install --save jpeg-turbo
```
